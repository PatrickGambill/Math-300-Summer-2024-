Then you can show all of them are. If you can find a polynomial time algorithm to any of these, you have solved P vs NP.

Even if a tractable algorithm is found, there are other encryption schemes that could replace RSA. older encryption schemes such as knapsack codes that have gotten renewed attention in recent years (with the push for quantum computing). In addition, we could build encryption based on NP hard problems like Traveling Salesman (optimal path formulation). \n",

Many NP-Complete problems (like Sudoku) have nice solutions for most practical cases. We only need a handful of unusually difficult sudoku puzzles to make it difficult to find an algorithm. Similarly, a polynomial time algorithm can be quite difficult to implement and create. If there are a large coefficients, this polynomial algorithm could take longer to run than an exponential algorithm in some cases. \n",

The float precision becomes an issue, and overflow errors also become a possible issue. If a polynomial time algorithm is found, it might not be practical to implement on an actual computer.
